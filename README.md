# gpcentre
Current Personal webpage. Simple HTML through ZendFramework Application. 

Site is being redone, moving to a Docker image, and migrated to Gitlab. Gitlab provides built-in continuous integration, and a whole slew of environment capabilities I plan to pay around with (e.g. full review process: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-examples/review-apps-nginx/tree/master) 

- New Repo: https://gitlab.com/gpcentre/gpcentre-net/
  - Currently uses: Docker, with custom built docker image.
